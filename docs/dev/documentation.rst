Documentation management
========================

This chapter describes all the processes related to the documentation of the
POP-Java project.


Documentation types
-------------------

The POP-Java project currently has two main types of documentation:

Prose documentation
   The documentation you are reading right now. It contains manuals, guides and
   how-tos about the project itself. The prose documentation is written by
   humans for humans. This documentation is currently edited using
   `Sphinx <http://sphinx-doc.org/>`_.

API reference
   The `API Reference <http://gridgroup.github.io/pop-java/api/>`_ contains the
   documentation for each functional unit of the project (packages, classes,
   methods, ...) and is generated by parsing the source code. The API reference
   is currently being generated using `Doxygen <http://www.doxygen.org/>`_.


Editing the prose documentation
-------------------------------

As mentioned in the previous section, the prose documentation is managed by
`Sphinx <http://sphinx-doc.org/>`_. Sphinx is a tool to create documentation
from reStructuredText sources and can produce a variety of output formats (e.g.
HTML, LaTeX -> PDF, ePub, Texinfo, man pages, plain text, ...).

The prose documentation resides in the ``docs/`` directory at the root of the
repository and can be edited with any text editor. The complete reference for
the reStructuredText syntax and the addons added by Sphinx are available on
the `reStructuredText <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html>`_ (see also
http://sphinx-doc.org/rest.html) and
`Sphinx Markup Constructs <http://sphinx-doc.org/markup/index.html>`_ pages,
respectively.

For quick and small edits, it is possible to use the GitHub editing interface
instead of a complete local clone + edit + commit + push process. The
documentation files are available on GitHub in the `gridgroup/pop-java
<https://github.com/gridgroup/pop-java/tree/master/docs>`_
repository.

Building and publishing the prose documentation
-----------------------------------------------

The building process transforms the input documents in reStructuredText format
into one of the output formats supported by Sphinx (HTML, PDF, ePub, ...).

There are two different ways to build the documentation:

* Locally on the development machine, by installing the necessary tools and
  executing the right command.
* Remotely, via a custom post-commit hook on a CI server or through a
  specialized service, such as http://readthedocs.org/.

In the next two subsections we will discuss these two possibilities. In the
second case we will limit ourselves to building through
http://readthedocs.org/.

Locally
~~~~~~~

To build the documentation locally we need a working
`Sphinx <http://sphinx-doc.org/>`_ installation.

Sphinx requires at least Python 2.5 or 3.1; you can read more about additional
details regarding the requirements on the
`Sphinx introduction <http://sphinx-doc.org/intro.html#prerequisites>`_ page.

To check  which version of python you have installed, run the following
command::

   python -V

If python is not installed or does not meet Sphinx's version requirements,
you can either install or update it by using your distribution package
manager (``apt-get`` on Debian/Ubuntu, ``yum`` on CentOS/Fedora, ``emerge`` on
Gentoo, ...).

Below we report some easy steps to install Sphinx on your system. For a more
complete walk-through (including platforms such as OS X and Windows), you can
always refer to the
`Sphinx installation instructions <http://sphinx-doc.org/latest/install.html>`_.

To install Sphinx, you can use either ``easy_install``::

   easy_install sphinx

or ``pip`` (recommended)::

   pip install sphinx

Depending on the platform and your setup, you probably have to run these
commands with administration privileges::

   sudo pip install sphinx

You can check if Sphinx was successfully installed by running the following
command::

   python -c 'import sphinx'

In addition to Sphinx itself, this documentation makes use of one additional
required and one additional optional packages:

* The ``bibtex`` extension allows to use BibTeX databases to manage
  references. You can install it by executing::

     pip install sphinxcontrib-bibtex

* The ``sphinx_rtd_theme`` is the theme used on Read The Docs. If the
  corresponding package is installed, it will be used for local builds as
  well. The theme can be installed by running::

     pip install sphinx_rtd_theme

.. note::

   If you had to use ``sudo`` When installing Sphinx, then the commands to
   install these additional packages will have to be prefixed with it as well.

Once you have a working Sphinx installation on your system, it's time to start
building your documentation. As the initial setup is already done for the
POP-Java project, you don't have to configure anything.

Different ways exist to build the documentation. The easiest is by far to use
the generated ``Makefile`` present in the ``docs/`` directory::

   cd path/to/pop-java/docs/
   make html

If successfull, the last line of the command output will indicate the location
of the build. In this case, the HTML files will be located in ``_build/html``.

To publish the generated documentation, it suffices to upload the ``html``
directory (or the equivalent artifact for a different output format) to a
publicly accessible web server.

In order to support the other output formats managed by Sphinx, the
``Makefile`` has different additional targets. You can find out more about them
by running the ``help`` target, whose output is shown below::

   Please use `make <target>' where <target> is one of
     html       to make standalone HTML files
     dirhtml    to make HTML files named index.html in directories
     singlehtml to make a single large HTML file
     pickle     to make pickle files
     json       to make JSON files
     htmlhelp   to make HTML files and a HTML help project
     qthelp     to make HTML files and a qthelp project
     devhelp    to make HTML files and a Devhelp project
     epub       to make an epub
     latex      to make LaTeX files, you can set PAPER=a4 or PAPER=letter
     latexpdf   to make LaTeX files and run them through pdflatex
     latexpdfja to make LaTeX files and run them through platex/dvipdfmx
     text       to make text files
     man        to make manual pages
     texinfo    to make Texinfo files
     info       to make Texinfo files and run them through makeinfo
     gettext    to make PO message catalogs
     changes    to make an overview of all changed/added/deprecated items
     xml        to make Docutils-native XML files
     pseudoxml  to make pseudoxml-XML files for display purposes
     linkcheck  to check all external links for integrity
     doctest    to run all doctests embedded in the documentation (if enabled)


readthedocs.org
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`Read the Docs (RTD) <https://readthedocs.org/>`_ is a free service to build
and host Sphinx documentation sets. It supports polling any GIT or Mercurial
repository and re-running a build each time a new commit is detected.
The POP-Java documentation is currently available on RTD at the following link:
http://pop-java.readthedocs.org/en/latest/.

In order to update the documentation hosted on RTD, it suffices to commit the
changes to the GIT repository and push them to the GitHub remote::

   git commit -m 'Documentation update'
   git push origin master

The repository hosted on GitHub is configured with a post-commit hook to
trigger a new RTD build and the updated version should be available in a short
time (usually < 2 minutes).

Thanks to RTD's integration with GitHub, an even easier way to carry out
small, self-contained edits to the documentation is directly through the
GitHub editing interface:

* Each HTML page generated on RTD contains a GitHub edit link in the right
  corner which brings up the GitHub interface browsing.

  .. figure:: ../images/ghedit1.png

* We can then click on the edit button to enter the editing interface.

  .. figure:: ../images/ghedit2.png

* From there we can carry out the desired changes, commit them directly (if
  the account with which we are logged in to GitHub allows it; fork and open a
  pull request otherwise) and have the documentation hosted on RTD updated
  automatically.

Building and publishing the API reference
-----------------------------------------

In the introduction to the present chapter we mentioned that the
`API Reference <http://gridgroup.github.io/pop-java/api/>`_ is currently being
generated using `Doxygen <http://www.doxygen.org/>`_. In the following
paragraphs we will describe how the documentation can be rebuilt and how the
resulting artifact can be published on the GitHub pages service.


Building
~~~~~~~~

To build the documentation you need a working installation of Doxygen on your
system. Extensive documentation about the installation process is available
directly from the
`Doxygen manual <http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/manual/install.html>`_.

Once installed, the steps needed to build the documentation are very simple::

   doxygen doxygen.conf

The resulting build will be available in the ``doxygen/html`` and
``doxygen/latex`` directories. The HTML version is ready to use, while the
LaTeX version needs and additional build to get to the PDF version::

   cd doxygen/latex
   make

The resulting PDF will be available at ``doxygen/latex/refman.pdf``.


Publishing on GitHub pages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

GitHub supports a basic kind of static website hosting, based on GIT
repositories. This service is called GitHub pages; you can find out more about
it on http://pages.github.com/.

Currently, the latest build of the HTML version of the API reference is made
available for browsing at http://gridgroup.github.io/pop-java/api/ and the PDF
version at http://gridgroup.github.io/pop-java/api/POP-Java.pdf.

The steps involved in the update process of the ``gh-pages`` branch (the branch
from which the static website is made available on GitHub) are summarized as
follows:

.. code-block:: bash

   git checkout gh-pages                   # Checkout the 'gh-pages' branch
   mv doxygen/html api                     # Move the built HTML reference into place
   git commit -am 'API reference update'   # Commit everything
   git push origin gh-pages                # Push to GitHub (publish)
   git checkout <oldbranch>                # Go back to the branch we were working on

To make it easier to build and publish the documentation, a script to automate
the process is made available at ``scripts/api-reference`` from the root of the
repository. In order to build, commit, and publish a new version of the API
reference, it suffices to execute it with no arguments::

   ./scripts/api-reference
