Communication
=============

Communication in POP is abstract, multiple communication protocols can be used at the same time. Those protocols are abstracted by the ``Combox`` object and its companion, a 3 generic and 3 helper classes for a total of 6.

:doc:`../user/plugin` explains how to create a new user generated Combox while in this chapter we want to explain what's behind a standard Combox and what happen between a Client's Interface and the POP Object's Broker.
