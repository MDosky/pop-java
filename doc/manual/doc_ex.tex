\subsection{Documentation}
All the library is documented under the Javadoc format. This documentation is installed on the computer after the completion of the POP-Java installation. A generated documentation under the standard Javadoc and also under the Doxygen format is available. The "index.html" file is located in the folder \textit{POPJAVA\_LOCATION}/doc/index.html gives acces to both Javadoc and Doxygen documentation.

\subsection{Examples}
The POP-Java distribution includes some examples of POP-Java application. These examples can be found in the folder \textit{POPJAVA\_DISTRIBUTION}/example. All examples have a makefile to compile and a special target "run" to run these examples. The following examples are available for the moment : 

\begin{itemize}
\item Callback example : this example shows the ability of a parallel object to call back the one who called him.
\item Integer example : this is a simple example of a parallel object integer (same as the example in POP-C++).
\item Mixed1 example : this example is a POP-Java application using a POP-C++ integer parallel object
\item Mixed2 example : this example is a POP-C++ application using a POP-Java integer parallel object.
\item Multiobj example : this example shows a chaining of parallel object.
\end{itemize}
