In this document we will explain how the Job Manager configuration file works
how to manually add new entries to it and how to do it programmatically.


1. Configuring manually

This file can be named however the user wish, the thing it has to make sure of
is that it is "feed" correctly to the POPJavaJobManager class at its creation.

The format is explained in the example file `jobmgr.conf' in two syntax.

This is file is also re-generated each time a permanent modification is 
requested to the Job Manager. This will remove any user create comments.


2. Configuring programmatically

To the user is given the possibility of creating a new instance of  the class 
PopJavaConfig, this class contains all the methods necessary for creating 
networks and neighbors, but also change the defaults value of the Job Manager.

An example utilisation should look like similar to this:

 config = new PopJavaConfig();
 config.registerNode("myNet", new NodeJobManager("localhost", 2713, "ssl"));
